## Grading

Currently TBD, though we will have two midterms. Midterm 1 is tentatively scheduled for October 3rd, in class. 


## On Time Policy (try not to be late)
No late homeworks or labs will be accepted unless an extension is granted by a staff member. Late projects will be marked off 20% per day late, rounded up to the nearest integer number of days. No project will be accepted more than 3 days late.

## Collaboration Policy (donâ€™t cheat)
Data science is a collaborative activity. While you may talk with others about the homework, we ask that you write your solutions individually. If you do discuss the assignments with others please include their names at the top of your notebook. Keep in mind that content from the homework and vitamins will likely be covered on both the midterm and final. We will be following the EECS departmental policy on Academic Honesty, so be sure you are familiar with it.
