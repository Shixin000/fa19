- **Homeworks:** There will be roughly 7 homework assignments. Assignments must be completed individually and will mix programming and short answer questions. Your lowest two homework scores will be dropped.
- **Labs:** There will usually be a lab every week, with some exceptions. Lab assignments will be graded on completion and correctness, but all test cases will be public. Your lowest two lab scores will be dropped.
- **Vitamins:** Vitamins are due each week, along with the lab assignment, and your two lowest Vitamin scores will be dropped. Each Vitamin will be scored out of 3 points, and full credit (3 out of 3) will be given to any on-time submission that answers at least 3 questions correctly. Most Vitamins have 5 questions. Answering only 1 or 2 questions correctly will earn 1 or 2 points, respectively. Late submissions will not receive credit.
- **Attendance:** In order to encourage you to attend lecture, 5% of your grade is based on lecture attendance (attendance is not taken in lab or discussion section). We will post a Google form each lecture for you to fill out. You will only need to check in to 2/3 of all lectures in order to receive the full 5% credit. If you would rather not have attendance be a part of your grade, we will weigh your final exam 5% more (30% instead of 25%). We will automatically take the higher of your two scores – the one with attendance included, and the one without.
- **Midterms:** We will have 2 midterms this semester. Tentatively, Midterm 1 will be in class on October 3rd, and Midterm 2 will be in class on November 5th. Our midterm alternate/replacement policy is TBD.
- **Final:** The final exam will be on Tuesday, December 17th, from 3-6pm. If you cannot make the regular final exam time for a pre-approved reason, there will be alternate final exam times. We will be releasing forms on Piazza in the first few weeks of the semester so that you can let us know of your conflicts (for both midterms and the final).
- **Undergrad vs. grad:** All students enrolled in the graduate version of the course (CS C200 or Stat C200C, i.e. Data 200) will be graded according to the Graduate grading scheme. Students enrolled in the undergraduate version of the course (Data 100) can opt for the graduate grading scheme, which involves a final project instead of labs and vitamins. All students in Data 100 who complete a final project will be scored under both grading schemes and given the higher of the two scores.

## On Time Policy (try not to be late)
No late homeworks or labs will be accepted unless an extension is granted **in advance**. In order to request an extension for an assignment, please use [this form](#) (link coming soon). Late projects will be marked off 20% per day late, rounded up to the nearest integer number of days. No project will be accepted more than 3 days late.

## Collaboration Policy (don’t cheat)
Data science is a collaborative activity. While you may talk with others about the homework, we ask that you write your solutions individually. If you do discuss the assignments with others please include their names at the top of your notebook. Keep in mind that content from the homework and vitamins will likely be covered on both the midterm and final. We will be following the EECS departmental policy on Academic Honesty, so be sure you are familiar with it.
