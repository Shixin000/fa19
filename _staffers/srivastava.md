Hey everyone, I'm a third year from Bombay majoring in data science, and this will be my second semester as TA. My interests include food, hiking, and comedy, so feel free to hit me up with your recommendations for restaurants, hiking trails, and standup specials. Data 100 helped me realise my passions for data science, and I hope it does for you too!
